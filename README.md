#Planet Hopper

This challenge focuses on implementing an AI captain for a spaceship that transports goods between planets. You will need to download
 the github repo to test your AI code, but only the Captain class (components\captain.py) should be modified.

#How it Works

###Goal

Accumulate 100,000 units of each resource (other than food). Resources onboard the ship don't count towards these totals.


###Planets

Each planet is capable of producing a particular resource. Each colonist on the planet is capable of producing 1 unit of the planet's resource per day
 if they have a sufficient amount of each resource. Each planet starts with 10 colonists and 1000 units of each resource.

###Resources

Each colonist needs a certain amount of each resource in order to harvest a planet's resource. If the planet doesn't have enough in its inventory
 no production will occur. Insufficient food will result in starvation of some or all of the colonists on the planet.

###Ship

The colonists have a single transport ship capable of interplanetary travel. The ship is responsible for distributing resources amongst the planets. Each time the
 ship docks on a planet all cargo and passengers are automatically offloaded.

###Captain

An instance of the Captain class is responsible for determining the destination and payload of the transport ship. Each day the ship is docked on a planet
 the Captain class's get_orders method will be called. Three dicts will be passed as arguments to Captain.get_orders: `world_info`, `ship_info` and `distances`. 
 
`world_info` contains a dict for each planet (keyed by planet name) with the following structure

    {"Planet name":
            {"pos": screen position of the planet,
            "inventory": {resource: amount of resource currently on the planet},
            "resource": name of the resource the planet produces,
            "consumption": {resource: planet's daily consumtion of resource},
            "num_colonists": number of colonists living on the planet}}            
    
`ship_info` a dict containg information about the transport ship

    {"speed": the distance (in pixels) that the ship can travel in a day    
      "destination": the planet name of the ship's destination (this will be None when Captain.update is called)
      "pos": the current screen position of the ship (this will be equal to the position of the planet the ship is docked at)
      "cargo": {resource: number of units of resource currently onboard}
      "colonists": number of colonists onboard}
    
`distances` a dict of dicts containing the distance between each planet

    {"planet name": {other_planet1: distance from planet to other_planet1,    
                             other_planet2: distance from planet to other_planet2,
                             ...}}
                             
These dicts are also passed to Captain.\_\_init\_\_.
                             
The Captain.get_orders method should return a dict representing the captain's orders

    {"destination": planet name,
     "cargo": {resource: num units of resource to carry to destination planet},
     "colonists": num colonists to bring to destination planet}
